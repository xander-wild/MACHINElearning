hi this is a visual representation of the covid 19 virus 
in which we have taken the property of the pathogen 
and made a hypotheticall sitation with a population of 4500 people 
in which we have taken an estimate that 90 % will come in contact some time 

with this hypothesis i have made this simulaiton you can change it to according to any 
ifectious diseases and just need to change the properties of pathogen 

you will have to install numpy and matplotlib for this 

>> pip install numpy
>> pip install matplotlib

you can run with can code editor or 
directly from terminal with 
>> python3 main.py
